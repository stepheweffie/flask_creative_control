<!-- A very simple variable-expansion feature is available for this file.
     Element or attribute values of the form $propname are expanded by looking for
     a corresponding JVM property (which, for instance, can be defined by adding
     -Dpropname=propvalue to the Server command line arguments in the launch
     script). If the property is not defined, then the element or attribute
     is considered as not defined at all.
     If <env_prefix> is set, it specifies a prefix such that, if a $propname
     value is found and propname starts with this prefix, the propname will
     be searched among the system environment variables rather than the JVM
     properties.
     If needed, the variable-expansion feature can be disabled for an element
     or for an element's attribute (let's say: attr) by adding prop_prefix=""
     or, respectively, attr_prop_prefix="" to the element (note that these
     "prop_prefix" attributes are handled in a special way). This also allows
     for setting a prefix other than "$".
     
     All the element or attribute values described as directory or file paths
     can be expressed as absolute or relative pathnames; when relative,
     they are considered as relative to the directory that contains this
     configuration file.
     Note that, on Windows, if a drive name is not specified, a double initial
     slash or backslash is needed to make a path absolute. -->
