# JAVA_OPTS should contain any Java Virtual Machine options. Here are some tips:
# 1) Always use the "-server" option, when available.
# 2) Give more RAM to the server process, especially with heavy traffic, by specifying a min and max "heap"
#    E.g.: If you have 4 GB and the box is dedicated to Lightstreamer, you might set 1 GB min heap and 3 GB max
#    heap with these options: "-Xms1G -Xmx3G"
# 3) Choose a better "garbage collector" if you want to reduce latency. This should not be needed since Java 9,
#    but if you are using Java 8 (apart from early versions) we suggest you enforcing:
#    "-XX:+UseG1GC". For previous versions, an option that often gives good results is:
#    "-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC". Many other tuning options are available (please see Oracle docs).
# 4) Configure the garbage collector in such a way as to prevent long pauses. If your Java installation
#    offers a "pauseless" collector, we encourage you to use it. Otherwise, choose the maximum pause
#    to be enforced, based on your latency and throughput requirements, but consider anyway that GC pauses
#    cause the connection to stay idle and pauses longer than 4 or 5 seconds may cause the clients
#    to timeout and reconnect.

# NOTE: By default, the script takes the current 'hard limit' granted to the shell process as the limit
# that can be made available to the Server.
# If, for any reason, the limit granted to the shell process in the execution environment is lower
# than the limit that is available to the involved user, the preferred limit (possibly including
# 'unlimited') can be specified by just changing the setting below. Note that if the limit supplied
# is higher than the limit granted to the user, the request may be just refused.
