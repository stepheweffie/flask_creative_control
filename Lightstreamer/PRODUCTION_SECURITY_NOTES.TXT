IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENTS
===================================================

When deploying a Lightstreamer Server instance in production environments,
please go through the following check list, to make sure that private
information on the Server operations are not accessible to unauthorized people.


1) Restrict access to the Monitoring Dashboard.

   The embedded Monitoring Dashboard is a handy tool to watch the status
   of Lightstreamer Server in real time and to administer Lightstreamer
   Server via the embedded JMX web client. To prevent unauthorized people
   to access the dashboard, edit the <dashboard> element
   in "lightstreamer_conf.xml" as follows:

   - set <public> to N

   - define at least a user id and a password

   - for further restrictions, you may want to:

     a) Isolate the Monitoring Dashboard to a different listening port
        and/or different NIC than those used for the external operations.
        Set <available_on_all_servers> to N and define the server that
        should serve the dashboard requests (servers are defined via the
        <http_server> and <https_server> elements at the beginning of
        "lightstreamer_conf.xml".

     b) Change the default dashboard URI, through <dashboard_url_path>.

   IMPORTANT: If your Lightstreamer Server edition supports SSL/TLS,
   make sure that the Monitoring Dashboard is available on an HTTPS
   server only, to protect passwords from being intercepted.


2) Restrict access to JMX.

   The Java Management Extensions (JMX) interfaces provide a
   standard means to monitor and administer Lightstreamer Server.
   You should protect the connectors as follows:

   a) Ensure that <public> inside the <rmi_connector> block in
      "lightstreamer_conf.xml" is set to N;
      then define at least a user id and a password within <rmi_connector>.

   b) Restrict access to the following JMX TCP ports
      (configured in "lightstreamer_conf.xml") through your firewall:
      - <port> (inside the <rmi_connector> block) (8888 by default)
      - <data_port> (inside the <rmi_connector> block) (unused by default)
      - <port> (inside the <jmxmp_connector> block) (unset by default)


3) Configure cross-origin policies.

   By default, the Server is configured to allow access from any page
   even on foreign hosts by having the <use_protected_js> element set
   to N and <cross_domain_policy> containing an "allow all" rule.
   You might want to restrict access by reconfiguring such elements.
   Note anyway that those rules only apply to browser-based JavaScript
   client connections and do not prevent in any way accesses from
   other kinds of clients.


4) If you use HTTPS, make it stronger.

   a) Ensure that the 256-bit cipher suites are installed in your
      Java Virtual Machine, as for some JVMs and in some countries
      such cipher suites need to be downloaded separately (search
      for "JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files").

   b) Disable support for low encryption ciphers (that is, usually,
      those with key length smaller than 128 bits):

      - Set the "LightstreamerLogger.connections.ssl" logger in
        "lightstreamer_log_conf.xml" to DEBUG and look in the log
        file for all the enabled cipher suites. Decide which should
        be disabled, based on your own security policy.

      - Leverage the <remove_cipher_suites> elements in
        "lightstreamer_conf.xml" and configure the cipher suites to
        disable. Note that the multiple lines are allowed; keeping
        the currently preconfigured lines is also advisable.
        You may choose to express the same restrictions by
        leveraging the <allow_cipher_suite> elements instead of the
        <remove_cipher_suites> ones.

   c) Disable support for weak protocols (for instance, the SSLv3
      protocol is considered a weak one; note that it is already
      disabled by the supplied factory configuration):

      - Set the "LightstreamerLogger.connections.ssl" logger in
        "lightstreamer_log_conf.xml" to DEBUG and look in the log
        file for all the enabled protocols. Decide which should
        be disabled, based on your own security policy.

      - Leverage the <remove_protocols> elements in
        "lightstreamer_conf.xml" and configure the protocols to
        disable. Note that multiple lines are allowed; keeping
        the currently preconfigured line is advisable.
        You may choose to express the same restrictions by
        leveraging the <allow_protocol> elements instead of the
        <remove_protocols> ones.


5) Remove the demos.

   You might not want to show any demo pages in production.
   Delete the "index.html" file and "welcome_res" folder within the
   "pages" folder.

   Furthermore, as it is recommended to host your pages on an
   external Web server, you can completely disable the Lightstreamer
   internal Web server by setting <enabled> to N within the
   <web_server> element in "lightstreamer_conf.xml".

   Delete the "welcome_res" folder inside the "adapters" folder, to
   remove the pre-installed WELCOME Adapter Set.


6) Disable Server version information disclosure.

   By default, the Server, when identifying itself to the clients
   (for instance through the "Server" HTTP response header) includes
   information on its current version and build.
   This may not be compliant with your security policies.
   In this case, you can suppress the inclusion of version information
   through the <server_tokens> configuration element.
