    This is a generic template for the configuration file of an Adapter Set
    pluggable into Lightstreamer Server.

    Note that element and attribute names are handled in a case sensitive way.

    A very simple variable-expansion feature is available; see

             the keepalive interval requested by this Proxy (see "keepalive_hint_millis").

        <!-- Optional.
             If Y, enforces TLS on the listening ports.
             The configuration of the ports (same for both) is done in a way similar
             to the TLS configuration in the Server's <https_server> blocks.
             See the available parameters below and find their meanings in the
             corresponding configuration elements in the Server configuration file.

             Note that the parameters with multiple values should be distinguished
             from one another by adding a dot-suffix
             (see for instance "tls.remove_cipher_suites" below).
             The choice of the suffix is free; however, if "config" is specified in
             "tls.enforce_server_cipher_suite_preference.order", then only numeric
             suffixes (not necessarily consecutive) will be accepted
             for "tls.allow_cipher_suite", to express the ordering.

             If N, the port configuration parameters below are ignored.
             Default: N. -->

             If Y, enforces Remote Adapter authentication on the connections
             based on user/password credential checks on both connections.
             Note that the user names will be used in log messages at INFO level
             or above, whereas the passwords won't.
             The configuration of the accepted credentials is shown below.
             Note that the various credential pairs should be distinguished

             If the second connection is not received within this time,
             the first connection is also invalidated.
             A zero or negative value stands for an unlimited timeout.

             and threads when assessing problems.

        <!-- Optional.
             Determines the initialization parameters to be sent to the remote
             counterpart.
             The supplied value is meant as a prefix, such that all parameters
             supplied to this Proxy Adapter and whose names start with this
             prefix will be sent. The value must contain a ':' character, as all
             parameter names that don't contain a ':' character are reserved.
             However, an empty prefix is also allowed, to have all configuration
             parameters sent to the remote counterpart.
             Anyway, the following parameters, with obvious meaning,
             will be provided by the Proxy Adapter and will also be sent:
             - ARI.version
             - keepalive_hint.millis (optional)
             - adapters_conf.id
             - data_provider.name
             Default: if not defined, no custom initialization parameters
             will be sent. -->

             Timeout for sent requests. A negative value stands for an unlimited timeout.
             Timed out requests are considered as failed and later answers are ignored.
             Default: 10000 ms (10 seconds). -->

        <!-- Optional.
             Specifies a comma-separated list of hosts allowed to connect to this proxy adapter
             in order to act as remote adapters.
             If a list is specified, connections received from addresses not in the list will be
             turned down, otherwise any connection will be accepted.
             The addresses can be in any form accepted by Java InetAddress.getByName method. -->

        <param name="remote_address_whitelist">localhost,192.168.0.190</param>
        -->

        <!-- Optional.
             Timeout for inactivity on the reply and notify channel from the
             Remote Data Adapter. It applies to the two channels independently.
             If neither replies/notifies nor keepalives are received within the specified
             timeout in either channel, the TCP connection will be considered broken
             and will be closed; as a consequence, the whole Server will be shut down.
             Setting a timeout is only meaningful if the Remote Data Adapter
             is configured to either send keepalive messages on both connections
             at a shorter interval, or obey the keepalive interval requested
             by this Proxy (see "keepalive_hint_millis").
             A zero or negative value stands for an unlimited timeout.
             Default: -1 (unlimited timeout). -->
        <!--
        <param name="keepalive_timeout_millis">10000</param>
        -->

        <!-- Optional.
             Keepalive interval to be requested to the Remote Data Adapter.
             The value should be low enough to ensure that, if obeyed, the connections
             will pass the timeout checks (see "keepalive_timeout_millis").
             A zero or negative value stands for no keepalive request, which still allows
             the Remote Data Adapter to send keepalives for its own purpose.
             Default: Depending on the setting of keepalive_timeout_millis:
             - if not configured: -1
             - if less than 4 seconds: half the keepalive_timeout_millis
             - otherwise: 2 seconds less than the keepalive_timeout_millis. -->
