Please read carefully all of the articles of the following Lightstreamer software use license (hereinafter referred to as "Agreement") before downloading and installing the software. Downloading and installing the software, either directly or through a third party, manifests your acceptance of all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not intend to accept the contents of this Agreement, you should not download or install the software. Instead, you should return it to Lightstreamer S.r.l. or destroy it.
Notwithstanding the fact that the present contract will be considered accepted and binding as described above, we encourage you to print and sign two copies of the present Agreement and to send one of the copies to the address indicated below.


1.        Use License. 
1.1        Lightstreamer S.r.l. (hereafter referred to as "Licensor"), following acceptance by you of all of the terms and conditions of the present Agreement and once payment of the contractually agreed amount, if any, is received by Licensor, grants you (hereafter referred to as "Licensee") this software use license permitting Licensee on a non-exclusive perpetual or time-limited basis to use the Software and the Documentation described in Sections 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 below. 
1.2        Software means the 'Lightstreamer' programs and related upgrades, fixes, and patches, (hereafter referred to as "Lightstreamer" or "Software"), which are the exclusive property of Licensor. The server component of the Lightstreamer programs (hereafter referred to as "Lightstreamer Server") is either provided directly as a final product or embedded into a derived product (for example, MQTT.Cool and JMS Extender). All the licensing clauses below refer to Lightstreamer Server, irrespective if it is provided directly or is embedded into a derived product. Similarly, all the license types below refer to "Lightstreamer" licenses (for example, "Lightstreamer Community Edition License"), even in case a derived product is being licensed (for example, "MQTT.Cool Community Edition License").
1.3        Documentation means all of the documentation related to the Software, including the user manuals, explanatory notes, and materials useful for the installation and functionality supplied by Licensor to Licensee, in any format, paper or electronic, at the moment of the consummation of the contract (hereafter referred to as "Documentation").
1.4        The Software and the Documentation can be used only and exclusively on the number of computers, with the numbers of users, with the time limitation, and with the restrictions on product editions and features, which will be agreed upon by the parties as set forth in the Offer Letter or in the Purchase Order and for which the corresponding sum will be paid, according to the obligation and limitations contractually determined. For the Free Licenses, as set forth in Section 1.11.1, the Offer Letter and the Purchase Order might not be employed; in such case, the limitations, restrictions, and obligations that apply are those defined in Section 1.11.1 and in the Software itself.
1.5        This license is non-exclusive and not transferable in any way, including in the form of a sublicense, subject to assignment on change of control. 
1.6        Licensee is entitled to redistribute Lightstreamer Client Libraries both as part of Licensee's applications and as standalone libraries.
1.7        Assistance, maintenance, and updating relating to the Software, aside from that for provided hereunder, are not a part of the present Agreement, as they may be provided for in a further agreement that may be entered into by the parties.
1.8        Licensing Mechanisms. There exist three licensing mechanisms:
1.8.1 "Cloud License Manager". Each instance of Lightstreamer Server periodically connects to a cloud-based license manager operated by Licensor, which can authorize or deny at any time the execution of the Lightstreamer Server process. Lightstreamer Server sends Cloud License Manager (CLM) the information needed to identify the License, the Audit Log (only if required by the license type), the number of CPU cores, and the peak number of user sessions (for statistical purpose). Licensee must ensure that the https endpoints of CLM, specified by Licensor, are reachable through the public Internet by the Lightstreamer Server instances. Every Lightstreamer Server instance must be able to connect to CLM at startup, in order to be authorized. Then, it must be able to connect at least every 45 minutes to keep operating, otherwise, it will be automatically terminated. Licensee is responsible to hold in confidence the assigned contract-id and password and not to disclose them to any person other than directly concerned with purposes of the Software operations.
1.8.2 "License File". A License File, to be installed on Lightstreamer Server, is provided by Licensor to Licensee for each License. Each License File contains the MAC address of one of the network interfaces of the machine on which the Lightstreamer Server is installed.
1.8.3 "No License Validation". Lightstreamer Server does not perform any license validation and is executed without requiring to connect to the Cloud License Manager and without requiring a License File.
1.9        "Audit Log". For some license types (as specified in Section 1.11), during the License validity period, Licensee must periodically provide Licensor with the audit log files for each of all the installed instances of Lightstreamer Server. The audit log files report the average number of Lightstreamer Sessions in each ten-minute slot of server operation. The Audit Log files must be delivered by Licensee to Licensor, via the means made available by Licensor, including automatic upload as described in Section 1.8.1 and Section 1.13, until Licensee declares in writing that it has definitively dismissed that instance. Licensee must make sure that the time difference among the clocks of the machines hosting Lightstreamer Server is of maximum 60 seconds (while respecting the time zone of each machine). Licensee must ensure that the Audit Log files for every instance of Lightstreamer Server are regularly collected and not altered.
1.10          License Duration. A license can have the following durations:
1.10.1 "Perpetual". A Perpetual license has no expiration and can be used perpetually unless the Agreement is terminated pursuant to Art. 6.
1.10.2 "Time Limited". A Time Limited license will expire at the end of the period for which it was purchased and the Software will stop working automatically. In any case, attempts to use the license after its expiration are expressly prohibited.

6.3        At the termination of the Agreement (in the event that this Agreement terminates as set forth herein) or at the end of the contract term, or at the expiration of a Time-Limited License, Licensee shall cease any and all use of the Software and Documentation and destroy the Software and Documentation, except as provided by law.


7.        Source Code Escrow
7.1        Escrow Agreement. Only if previously agreed by the parties, concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, the parties will execute a third-party escrow Agreement in a form on which they shall agree (the "Escrow Agreement"), in conjunction with an escrow agent that they shall both approve (the "Escrow Agent").
7.2        Deposit. Upon execution of the Escrow Agreement, Licensor will deposit with the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the procedures of the Escrow Agreement, the source code for the Software and Documentation, and the list of tools needed to create the binary version. Licensor will deposit any updated source code and Documentation with the Escrow Agent ("Deposit Material" refers to material required to be deposited pursuant to this Section 7.1).
7.3        License and Use. Contingent upon the accrual of Release Conditions, Licensor hereby grants Licensee a license to use, reproduce, and create derivative works from the Deposit Material, Licensee may not distribute or sublicense the Deposit Material or make any use of it whatsoever except for such internal use as is necessary to maintain and support the Software. Copies of the Deposit Material created or transferred pursuant to this Agreement are licensed, not sold, and Licensee receives no title to or ownership of any copy of the Deposit Material itself. The Deposit Material constitutes Confidential Information of Licensor pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof. Licensee may not exceed the number of production licenses, neither use different license typology, neither different features than the number of production licenses, typology, and features owned.
7.4        Release Conditions.  The Escrow Agent shall release the Deposit Material to Licensee solely under any of the following conditions (each a "Release Condition"): (i) appointment, or consent to a receiver, trustee or another custodian for Licensor or substantially all of its assets, or application for same if such application is not lifted within 14 days; (iii) Licensor makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (iv) Licensor is liquidated or dissolved, or any proceedings are commenced with regard to Licensor under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor’s relief law which are not lifted within 14 days from commencement; (v) any failure by Licensor to function as a going concern.
7.5        Costs. All costs of the escrow, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the fees of the Escrow Agent, shall be borne and paid directly by Licensee.
7.6        Duration. The Escrow Agreement will commence on the date of the deposit to the Escrow Agent and will automatically terminate when all acquired Time-Limited licenses expire and all acquired Perpetual licenses are no more covered by maintenance service.
7.7 As set out above, this article and all the provisions contained therein will only apply in case Licensee had chosen the "Source Code Escrow" option. In this case, all the conditions between the parties will be regulated separately in the Escrow Agreement which, therefore - in case of contrast between the following and the Escrow Agreement – will prevail. 


8.        Applicable Law and Competent Forum.
8.1          THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF ENGLAND WITHOUT REGARD FOR ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS.  
8.2        All disputes arising out of or in connection with the Agreement shall be finally settled in arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), by 3 (Three) arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. The place of arbitration shall be Milan (Italy). The language of the arbitration shall be English. Any Party shall have the right to have recourse to and shall be bound by the pre-arbitral referee procedure of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in accordance with its Rules for a Pre-Arbitral Referee Procedure.

8.3        Alternatively, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY CONSENTS AND AGREES TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT OF BRUXELLES IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.


9. Miscellaneous.
9.1        The possible nullity of one or more of the clauses of this Agreement will not invalidate the other clauses in the Agreement.
